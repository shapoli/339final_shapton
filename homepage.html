                <h1>Welcome!</h1>
                <p>This website gives insight into my work as a student, designer, and collaborator. Falling into the world of art and design as a little kid, I have continued to grow as a designer and individual from creating illustrations, physical pieces, and now exploring user experience design.
                </p>
                <p>Designing meaningful quality pieces is something I strive for in my work and I’m excited to strengthen my passion for creating and learning through different mediums and practices. This portfolio offers a glimpse into my creative process and the start of my journey as a designer. </p>

                <h1> A little about who I am...</h1>
                <p>I’m currently a junior at the University of Michigan studying user experience design in the School of Information with a minor in fine arts and product design. As I continue to learn and grow skills in user experience design, I still love working with my hands, creating physical products such as chairs and tables, as well as drawing and painting. Aside from working on school projects, I love to be in the kitchen with my family cooking and baking, or being in the wood shop with my father working on our latest project. </p>
