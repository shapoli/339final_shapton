                <h1>Our Idea</h1>
                <p>My childhood home has always been a place for creativity and growth. Purchased by my mother before she even knew who my father was, the home has been a growing project and a piece of our family to this day. When our kitchen ceiling fell down, instead of drywall, our ceiling became an array of elementary paintings taped together by my grandfather. The hole in our bathroom became a wishing well where all our spare change ended up. Our kitchen table, used for endless family meals was covered in paint, glue, and glitter. As we grew and our home matured with us, my father and I decided it was time to give our home and our family a new place to eat, work, and gather.</p>
                <p>Over the span of two years, we designed and created a dining table that fit the needs of our family, and reflected the unique qualities from our home. Made from an old walnut tree in the backyard, we produced a table with love, comfort, and quality in mind.</p>

                <h1>Research and Design</h1>
                <p>The main goal for this project was to create a table that was simple, elegant, and built exactly for the room that it would sit in. Using AutoCAD and our own illustrations we designed a table that would work perfectly for each family member, including the dogs. Our table is meant for gathering, lounging, working, and appreciating. </p>
                <p>We went through many iterations to create a piece that was nice to look at, but even better to use. Maintaining simplicity and efficiency, I designed replaceable aluminum panels in the center that are great for holding hot pots and dishes. However, these panels can be swapped out for other module designs such as power banks for working or even an array of flowers that rest in the slots.</p>
                <p>With design in mind we made sure each element of the table reflected its counterparts in the kitchen. The table legs are color matched to the gunmetal cabinets that sit against the wall. The cream upholstery mimics the drawers that line the walls, and the dark grey aluminum compliments the  countertops that wrap around the kitchen.</p>
                <p>This piece is truly made for the kitchen it lives in, and it’s meant to be loved and used.</p>

                <h1>Construction</h1>
                <p>During the construction process, our main goal was to create a table that used as little material as possible and focused on simplicity. Each bench and the table only have four pieces of wood and four aluminum legs. That’s it.</p>
                <p>We didn’t want decorations or bulky materials, but a table that blended in with the environment around it. We constructed the open centers with adjustable wooden holders so the aluminum panels can be replaced easily. </p>
                <p>The cushions, which use waterproof and stain resistant sunbrella fabric, snap onto the benches allowing them to be removed, washed, or replaced.</p>

                <h1>Final Product & Future Ideas</h1>
                <p>My childhood home will always be a place that is lively and busy. Even though all the kids are out of the house, you can still hear laughter down the halls and people working at the kitchen table. When everyone comes home to be together, we always congregate at the dining table, a place that is meant for talking, laughing, and eating. Now a new table sits in our favorite part of the home, created with each of us in mind. We hope that table will serve its intended purpose and I’m excited to begin working on our next family project using the same wood from our backyard.</p>
