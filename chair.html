            <h1>A Chair from Copenhagen</h1>
            <div class="learning-text">
                <h1>Learning and Exploring</h1>
                <p>During the summer of 2022 I decided to study abroad in Copenhagen, Denmark. For two months I studied furniture design, visited designers, museums, and creators with the final assignment of producing a full sized chair.  </p>
                <p>As we learned and designed within our studios, we created initial designs, prototypes, and scale drawings as we prepared to create our final chair. </p>
                <p>Taking inspiration from the Spanish Chair by Børge Mogensen and the environment that surrounded me during the trip, my goal was to create a lounge chair that was chunky, comfy, and simply. </p>

            <div class = "learning-images">

            </div>
            
            <div class="initial-text">
                <h1>Initial Designs</h1>
                <p>To begin the process, started with various potential designs. At first I focused on the structure, creating various ways the chair would sit, where the joints would go, and how the armrests would be styled. </p>
                <p>From there I figured out how I would want to connect the two sides, creating options that included all wood, woven fabric, and even cushions. </p>
                <p>My intentions for this chair was to focus on the construction and understand how chairs are built. As I created variations I finally found a design that was most realistic and suitable for the work we would be doing in such a short time frame. </p>

            </div>

            <div class="prototypes-text">
                <h1>Prototypes</h1>
                <p>After creating initial sketches I moved on to produce a 1:5 scale model and then a 1:1 scale model to understand the dimensions and materials needed before producing the final piece. As I created each model, I discovered issues with my designs each time and altered them in autoCAD to be more functional.</p>
                <p> I redesigned the stretchers (which hold the two sides together) and their positions so it created natural tension for the woven fabric, making it a more comfortable experience. As I prototyped I finalized my chair and prepared for final production. </p>

                <h1>Construction</h1>
                <p>Spending two weeks in the wood shop,  I worked with talented cabinetmakers and designers, who taught us the skills needed to create our chairs. From raw oak wood I slowly produced my lounge chair, learning about the Danish design process along the way.</p>
                <p>Once finally crafted, I sanded the chair until smooth and finished it with soap, a mixture Danish cabinet makers use to maintain the natural finish while protecting the wood from outside elements. For the weaving fabric I sourced mauve cotton straps that would be used for the back and seat rest.</p>

            <div class="final-text">
                <h1>Final Piece</h1>
                <p>In the end, with no time to spare, I was able to fulfill my goal of creating a lounge chair that took inspiration from the Spanish Chair. With a chunky style and large armrests, the chair I created is meant to be comfortable, functional, and simple. I wanted a chair I could read in, work in, and even sit criss cross in. </p>
                <p>While I'm happy with the final product there’s a lot of work the chair still needs if I were to reproduce it. Through my time in Copenhagen, I was able to learn about the culture and history of its people and their infamous furniture design.</p>
                <p>Along this exciting and tiring journey I learned that furniture production and design takes many iterations until you get it just right. While my chair is nowhere near perfect, I was able to  so much from it and I can’t wait to take those skills and keep learning more.</p>
